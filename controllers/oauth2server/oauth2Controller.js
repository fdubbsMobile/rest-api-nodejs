/**
 * User authorization endpoint
 *
 * `authorization` middleware accepts a `validate` callback which is
 * responsible for validating the client making the authorization request.  In
 * doing so, is recommended that the `redirectURI` be checked against a
 * registered value, although security requirements may vary accross
 * implementations.  Once validated, the `done` callback must be invoked with
 * a `client` instance, as well as the `redirectURI` to which the user will be
 * redirected after an authorization decision is obtained.
 *
 * This middleware simply initializes a new authorization transaction.  It is
 * the application's responsibility to authenticate the user and render a dialog
 * to obtain their approval (displaying details about the client requesting
 * authorization).  We accomplish that here by routing through `ensureLoggedIn()`
 * first, and rendering the `dialog` view.
